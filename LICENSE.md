REGARDING MODPACKS:
This mod is designed for the Silvania minecraft server only.
If you wish for it to be included in a modpack, email me at flenix@silvania.co.uk or send me a message on Minecraft Forums, Forge Forums or Silvania Forums. You MUST have my permission to redistribute this, and you should at least ask me before using this on an open multiplayer server (which includes whitelist only!)

If you just wish to use with a few friends, and you all download it uniquely, that is fine. Anything else, drop me a message first, I'll usually say yes.

Note: None of my mods are allowed in the Technic launcher, ever. If you want to know why, feel free to ask, but I wont allow it; use Feed the Beast instead.
